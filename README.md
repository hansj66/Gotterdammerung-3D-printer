Götterdämmerung 3D printer
==========================

This 3D printer project is in development. The printer is functional, but the design and bill of materials are still subject 
to change.

The printer frame is made of 40x40 mm aluminium extrusions and it is extremely rigid. All idlers use ball bearings and 
the combination of 12mm steel axis and linear bearings ensures a stable platform.
The design scales in X/Y/Z without changes to any printed parts.
